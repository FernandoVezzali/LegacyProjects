Demo Store


This article is intent to address a common misunderstandings about ASP.NET MVC, as well as propose a project 
structure which will physically separate the many concerns of an application in a such explicitly way that 
will be easy to identify what each part is doing, providing a clear idea about the expected behaviour of 
the whole application. 

I want to show you how these different parts of the application interact between them, always keeping in 
mind the five main principals of Object Orientation, the mnemonic acronym SOLID (link to definition). 
I am also going to talk about some Design Patterns that are tightly related with MVC, such as Repository, 
MVVM and many others. 

Please do not take it as a silver bullet, I truly believe in "Use the right Tool for the right job".
